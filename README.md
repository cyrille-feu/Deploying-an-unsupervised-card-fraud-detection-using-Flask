# Deploying-an-unsupervised-card-fraud-detection-using-Flask

Card fraud is a prevalent issue in the financial industry. The goal is to build a system for unsupervised card fraud detection using an Isolation Forest model. The model will be trained on a fake generated dataset containing relevant features, and the Flask web app will provide an interface for interacting with the model. The end goal is to detect anomalies in transactions, indicating potential fraudulent activities.

below are the steps:

- Generate a Fake Dataset
- Build, Train, and Save Isolation Forest Model
- Create Flask Web App with an api endpoint
- test the api on thunder
- deploy the model on render
